    <h2>Stan Lee</h2>
    <p>
      Spider-Man was co-created by <em>Stan Lee</em> in the early 1960s during his legendary era at Marvel Comics.
      Born in 1922 as Stanley Martin Lieber, Stan Lee became one of the most influential comic book writers in history.
      He wanted to create a teenage superhero who wasn’t a sidekick, but a relatable main character with real-life problems.
      His idea of a hero who struggles with school, money, and responsibility became a groundbreaking shift in comics.
      He also shaped Spider-Man’s voice and the famous message:
      <strong>“With great power comes great responsibility.”</strong>
